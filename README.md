## About Oxford Learnerâ€™s Dictionaries
### Pronunciation
These guides will help you to understand and use the pronunciation symbols used in our dictionaries. 
The dictionaries use slightly different pronunciation systems. 

The Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD) and the Oxford Learner's Dictionary of Academic English (OLDAE) use a system that will be more familiar to learners of British English in Europe and elsewhere. 

The Oxford Advanced American Dictionary (OAAD) system represents American English pronunciation only and will be more familiar to learners of American English, especially within the United States.
